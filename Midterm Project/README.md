<h1> Bloody Mary </h1>
<h3> An interactive mirror, haunted by <i> Bloody Mary</i> </h3>
<p> This project is an interactive mirror that uses the themes and narrative of the childrens game, Bloody Mary. The rules of the game include going into the bathroom, turning the lights off and having the child (participant) say "Bloody Mary" three times and bloody mary will appear </p>
<p> The story, however, refers to and draws from Queen Mary I of England who is refered to as "bloody mary", a nickname given to her since during her five-year reign, Mary had over 300 religious dissenters burned at the stake in what are known as the Marian persecutions</p>
<p> Our interactive mirror can detect someones presence near the mirror and if someone dares to touch it and will respond accordingly</p>
