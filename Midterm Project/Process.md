<h3> 1. Narrative </h3> 
<p> The narrative was actually one of the components that kept changing. We initially wanted the narrative to be that the mirror is haunted by children and we wanted to find scary children sounds to install onto our mirror. And we kind of just left it there and focused on what and how the mirror is interactive. This worked our because all our scenarios and interactions were going to be the same and the narrative would only control the sounds and external decoration of the mirror. </p>
