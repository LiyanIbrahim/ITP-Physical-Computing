This lab was very fun, I think that was mainly because I (for the most part) understood how and why things connect so it was easier to trouble shoot. I used two pots and one button to control the circle in p5js. </br> 
I had an issue last weeek were there was a lag between the graph and pot value but this week, the lag wasn't there and the circle responded well the change in pot/button values.
