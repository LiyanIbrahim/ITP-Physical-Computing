This week's labs were cool because they started giving me a sense of how a range of readings that we can produce can be read by a computer and used to control a physical object. The lab went on relatively smoothly and I tried to document most of the circuits I produced and link them here.

I had some trouble with the pressure sensor, particularly trying to use two pressure sensors to control 2 LEDs. My main issue was figuring out if what was happening to my circuit is what was meant to happen since the change in the LEDs was so faint but they did change with pressure
