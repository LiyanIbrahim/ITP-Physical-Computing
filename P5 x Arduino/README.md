<p> This weeks lab was pretty exciting since I've never done something like this before but I did run into some issues and I did not know how to debug when two softwares are interacting in that capacity.</p>

<h3> Lab 1</h3>
<p> This lab was exciting since it made me understand and work with serial communication (& it worked!)</p>

<h3> Lab 2 </h3>
<p> This lab worked and I got the changes in the pot values to reflect on the program & graph but there was a lag(?) in reading the values and I did not know why. I tried to go back and completely rewire the arduino and it still had a lag. The lag was mainly between when I changed the pot, the value on the screen would take a bit to reflect that change</p>

<h3> Lab 3</h3>
<p> This lab was very exciting but I faced the most issues in it. I could not get the mouse coordinates to control the LEDs and I tried to restart arduino and then load p5.js again to see if the issue was with that and it still would not work. The LED was wired correctly because I then ran a simple arduino code to see if it would light up and it did. And it also worked with I was controlling the LED with arduino by writing "H" or "L". But writing in "H"/"L" on p5.js did not work either. I kept getting a referance error of "ReferenceError: L is not defined"
