The speaker:</br> 
The speaker lab was relatively straightforward and fun to create. I soldered the wires on the speaker and when I tried the first part of the lab and it didn’t work, part of my debugging was trying to figure out if the wires were soldered wrong. I did eventually figure out the issue and it was the resistor value I was using but that also got me wondering how someone can figure out if their soldering is what is messing up the circuit. 
Otherwise, here are some vids/pics of what I did

The motor: </br> 
This lab was a bit more challenging for me. I think it was mainly because it is sometimes hard for me to figure out if the code is doing what it is supposed to if the physical components are changing when connecting to the arduino. There was some variation to the motor but I wasn’t sure if it was because of the code or a random arduino/physical glitch.
