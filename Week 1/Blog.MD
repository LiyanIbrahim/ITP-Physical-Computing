I followed this week's lab assignment. I mainly used a power supply to power the LEDs and motors. I took these pictures and videos to document the work but I tried using the arduino to power the LEDs in class and that worked as an independent power supply but also using the arduino software to control the LED. 

Also, (this is not pictured here haha) but I tried to use a potentiometer to power and control the motor but it didn't work. It worked with the LED but I think the way I set it up for the motor was either not correct or I was using the wrong parts to do this.
